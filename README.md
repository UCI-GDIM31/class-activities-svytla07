Hello World!

Table #4 - We would make the return type boolean because whether or not the player hit the beat can be described with true if they hit the beat and false if they did not. For the parameters we would make them floats, float x and float y and float x would be the time it took the player to press the button and the float y would be the time the key should be pressed within. 1. The metaphor we came up with is that Classes are like the instructions for lego building blocks and components are the possible builds you can make with the blocks. Additionally, we said that variables are the bricks and methods are the different ways you can use the bricks to make something. 2.

Table #9 - Line 5 is intitializing a float variable for movement speed, setting it's value as 1 and making it be able to be changed in the inspector in Unity. Line 22 is using an algoritim to calculate how much the cat is going to move verticially by mutiplying the speed by the amount of time that the player has pressed the button for. Line 25 seems to be moving the object to the position based on the amount calculated in line 22. I chose to add rigid body for the Cat object and for the Soccer Ball object. I checked the Is Trigger box for the Goal object. My game did not work properly at first because the cat would keep falling through the floor so I had to get rid of having the Is Trigger box checked but after that it worked.
